# 🧠 Brain Tumor Classification using Deep Learning

This project focuses on classifying brain tumors using a deep learning model built and tested in Google Colab. The system analyzes MRI images and predicts the type of brain tumor, helping in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## 🚀 Features
- Upload MRI images
- Preprocessing and augmentation
- CNN-based model for tumor detection
- Accurate classification into tumor types

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- Google Colab

## 📊 Dataset
- Publicly available MRI brain tumor dataset (custom split for training & testing)

## 📁 Project Structure
- `BrainTumorClassifier.ipynb`: Main Colab notebook
- `README.md`: Project overview

## ✅ Output
Accurate prediction with classification result (e.g., glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, or no tumor)
